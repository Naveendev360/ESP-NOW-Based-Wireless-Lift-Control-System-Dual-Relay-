#  ESP32 Wireless Lift Control System (ESP-NOW Based)

This project demonstrates a **low-latency**, **safe**, and **Wi-Fi-independent** lift control system using two ESP32 boards via **ESP-NOW communication protocol**.

##  Project Overview

- **Sender Unit**: Push-button interface to control lift direction.
- **Receiver Unit**: Relay interface to control actual lift motors.
- **Protocol**: ESP-NOW (2.4 GHz, peer-to-peer)
- **Safety**:
  - Only one relay activates at a time.
  - If signal is lost or sender is powered off ‚Üí Receiver stops immediately (heartbeat timeout).
  - Holding the button keeps relay ON; releasing turns it OFF.

##  Hardware Used

| Module          | Sender             | Receiver           |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| ESP32 Dev Board | YES                 | YES                 |
| Push Buttons    | 2 (GPIO14, 27)     | NO                |
| Relays          | NO                 | 2-channel (GPIO18, 19) |
| Power Supply    | 5V USB or Adapter  | 5V Relay-powered   |
| Enclosure       | Custom 3D printed case (Sender + Receiver)

---

##  How It Works

- **Sender** reads buttons every 100ms and sends their states + a timestamp (`millis()`).
- **Receiver** listens to sender data and mirrors button presses to relays.
- If no message is received within 300ms ‚Üí all relays turn OFF for safety.

---

##  Struct Used

```cpp
typedef struct struct_message {
  bool btn1Hold;
  bool btn2Hold;
  unsigned long timestamp;
} struct_message;
```

Used to package and send the state of both buttons and the current `millis()` value to ensure heartbeat timing.

---

##  Heartbeat Explanation

- **Purpose**: Detect communication loss.
- **Logic**: If the time since the last received message exceeds `300ms`, the receiver turns OFF all relays.
- `millis()` provides system uptime used for timing.

##  Safety Features Summary

- One relay ON at a time (Button 1 locks out Button 2).
- Real-time heartbeat check ensures safe operation.
- Releasing button ‚Üí relay OFF instantly.
- No Wi-Fi required. Reliable in field conditions.
